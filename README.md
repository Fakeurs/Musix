TuneTalk is a social platform built for music lovers. Unlike typical music apps, TuneTalk lets you share songs instantly, chat about them in real-time, and even post your own recordings—all in one place.

## 🌟 Hackathon Track
This project was built as part of the ✨ Make Anything, But Make it YOU (Beginner-Friendly Track) in the CS Girlies Hackathon 2025.
We chose this track because we wanted to create something personal, fun, and meaningful that reflects our ideas and passion and this project truly felt like us!


## 🚀 Inspiration
We didn’t just want to build another music app—we built something we truly wished existed. You know that feeling when you find a song so good, you just want to scream it into your group chat? We’ve been there.
We really wanted a platform where you could listen to music and share it instantly with your friends, right there, in real time. But surprisingly, we couldn’t find anything that captured that vibe. No app truly let us combine music, chat, and expression in one space.
Most music apps focus only on listening. We wanted something that brings people together—an app where you can instantly share a song, discuss it with friends, or showcase your own singing. That’s how TuneTalk was born.

🎵 Features
1. Real-Time Chat – Powered by Socket.IO, chat live with friends and share music instantly.
2. Spotify Integration – Share and play songs directly in the chat using the Spotify API.
