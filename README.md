## 🚀 Inspiration
Most music apps focus only on listening. We wanted something that brings people together—an app where you can instantly share a song, discuss it with friends, or showcase your own singing. That’s how TuneTalk was born.

🎵 Features
1. Real-Time Chat – Powered by Socket.IO, chat live with friends and share music instantly.
2. Spotify Integration – Share and play songs directly in the chat using the Spotify API.
3. Music-Only Feed – Post your favorite tracks or personal recordings with like & comment functionality.
4. Public/Private Sharing – Decide who gets to see your shared music.
